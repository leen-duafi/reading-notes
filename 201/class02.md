* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go

## structure
* **headinh**

Browsers display the contents of 
headings at different sizes. The 
contents of an <h1> element is 
the largest, and the contents of 
an <h6> element is the smallest.

* **paragraph**


To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.
By default, a browser will show 
each paragraph on a new line 
with some space between it and 
any subsequent paragraphs

* **<b>**

By enclosing words in the tags 
<b> and </b> we can make 
characters appear bold

* **<i>**

By enclosing words in the tags 
<i> and </i> we can make 
characters appear italic


* **<br>**

 But if you wanted 
to add a line break inside the 
middle of a paragraph you can 
use the line break tag <br />.


* **<hr />**

To create a break between 
themes — such as a change of 
topic in a book or a new scene 
in a play — you can add a 
horizontal rule between sections 
using the <hr /> tag

* **<strong>**

The use of the <strong>
element indicates that its 
content has strong importance. 
For example, the words 
contained in this element might 
be said with strong emphasis.

* **<blockquote>**

The <blockquote> element is 
used for longer quotes that take 
up an entire paragraph. Note 
how the <p> element is still 
used inside the <blockquote>
element.

* **<audio>**

HTML5 introduced the <audio>
element to include audio files 
in your pages. As with HTML5 
video, browsers expect different 
formats for the audio.

* HTML5 introduces new <video> and <audio>
elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but 
these are only supported in the latest browsers

### css

* CSS allows you to create rules that control the 
way that each individual box (and the contents 
of that box) is presented

**Selectors** indicate which 
element the rule applies to. 
The same rule can apply to 
more than one element if you 
separate the element names 
with commas.

**Declarations** indicate how 
the elements referred to in 
the selector should be styled. 
Declarations are split into two 
parts (a property and a value), 
and are separated by a colon

**Properties** indicate the aspects 
of the element you want to 
change. For example, color, font, 
width, height and border.

**Values** specify the settings 
you want to use for the chosen 
properties. For example, if you 
want to specify a color property 
then the value is the color you 
want the text in these elements 
to be

#### java script

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript 
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and 
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like 
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.

You should write **comments** to explain what your code does. 
They help make your code easier to read and understand. 
This can help you and others who read your code.

**NUMERIC DATA TYPE**
The numeric data type handles 
numbers.

**STRING DATA TYPE**
The strings data type consists of 
letters and other characters.

**BOOLEAN DATA TYPE**
Boolean data types can have one 
of two values: true or false. 

#### function

* Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task. 
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value. 
* An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window. 
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets (and both can contain the other).
