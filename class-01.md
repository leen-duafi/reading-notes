## different ways in which people access the web 
* **Browsers**

People access websites using 
software called a web browser. 
Popular examples include 
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, 
Chrome, and Opera

* **Web Servers**

When you ask your browser for 
a web page, the request is sent 
across the Internet to a special 
computer known as a web 
server which hosts the website.

* **Screen readers**

 are programs 
that read out the contents of a 
computer screen to a user. They 
are commonly used by people 
with visual impairments.
In the same way that man

* **Devices**

People are accessing websites 
on an increasing range of devices 
**including** desktop computers, 
laptops, tablets, and mobile 
phones. It is **important** to 
remember that various devices 
have different screen sizes and 
some have faster connections to 
the web than others


### HTML Describes the Structure of Pages
* To 
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want 
to appear on the page.

* **Elements** are usually 
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag 
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser 
something about the information that sits between its opening and 
closing tags

* **Attributes** provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign


* ** <body>**

Everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window.

* **<head>**

Before the <body> element you 
will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 

You will usually find a **<title>**
element inside the <head>
element.
**<title>**The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the 
same time)

## FORM 
The **<form>** element uses the action attribute to indicate the page that 
the data is being sent to. Each of the form controls sits inside the <form>
element. Different types of form control are suited to collecting different 
types of data. The <fieldset> element is used to group related 
questions together. The <label> element indicates the purpose of each 
form control

* Whenever you want to collect information from 
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a 
<form> element.
*  Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

* Each form control is given a name, and the text the 
user types in or the values of the options they select 
are sent to the server.
* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it 
easier for visitors to fill in forms


## DOCTYPE
Because there have been 
several versions of HTML, each 
web page should begin with a 
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a 
browser which version of HTML 
the page is using

## Comments in HTML

<!-- -->
If you want to add a comment 
to your code that will not be 
visible in the user's browser, you 
can add the text between these 
characters

## ID Attribute

Every HTML element can carry 
the id attribute. It is used to 
uniquely identify that element 
from other elements on the 
page. Its value should start with 
a letter or an underscore (not a 
number or any other character).
It is important that no two 
elements on the same page 
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is 
no longer unique)

## Class Attrupte
Every HTML element can 
also carry a class attribute. 
Sometimes, rather than uniquely 
identifying one element within 
a document, you will want a 
way to identify several elements 
as being different from the 
other elements on the page. 

## block level elements

Some elements will always 
appear to start on a new line in 
the browser window. **These are 
known as block level elements. **

* Examples of block elements are 
<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.

## inline elements

 Some elements will always 
appear to continue on the 
same line as their neighbouring 
elements. These are known as 
inline elements.

**Examples** of inline elements are 
<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.

## <div>
The <div> element allows you to 
group a set of elements together 
in one block-level box

## Grouping Text & Elements Inline

* ** <span>** elements 
is so that they can control the 
appearance of the content of 
these elements using CSS.

* **iframe** is like a little window 
that has been cut into your 
page — and in that window you 
can see another page. The term 
iframe is an abbreviation of inline 
frame.
* **src**
The src attribute specifies the 
URL of the page to show in the 
frame.
* **height**
The height attribute specifies 
the height of the iframe in pixels.
* **width**
The width attribute specifies 
the width of the iframe in pixels

## image

* You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. 
This is very helpful when you use the same sized 
images on several pages of your site.
* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically 
using CSS.
*  You can use a background image behind the box 
created by any element on a page. 
* Background images can appear just once or be 
repeated across the background of the box.
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the 
background position of an image.
*To reduce the number of images your browser has to 
load, you can create image sprite

## header / footer / nav / article /section

The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
* The main header or footer 
that appears at the top or 
bottom of every page on the 
site.
* A header or footer for an 
individual <article> or 
<section> within the page.

** The <nav> **  
 element is used to 
contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the 
primary site navigation

**The <article>**

 element acts as 
a container for any section of a 
page that could stand alone and 
potentially be syndicated.

**The <section>**

 element groups 
related content together, and 
typically each section would 
have its own heading.

## HTML5 LAYOUT

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
different parts of a web page and help to describe 
its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google

## java script

* A script is a series of instructions that a 
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

* To write a script, you need to first 
state your goal and then list the 
tasks that need to be completed in 
order to achieve it.


 1: DEFINE THE GOAL 
First, you need to define the task you want to 
achieve.

2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
To design a script you split the goal out into a series 
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this 
puzzle. 

3: CODE EACH STEP 
Each of the steps needs to be written in a 
programming language that the compu ter 
understands..


* **Vocabulary:** The words that computers 
understand 
* **Syntax:** How you put those words together to 
create instructions computers can follow 

## FLOWCHART

* Arrows show how the script moves from one task 
to the next. The different shapes represent diff€rent 
types of tasks. In some places there are decisions 
which cause the code to follow different paths. 

## COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA

* OBJECTS (TH INGS) 
In computer programming, each physical thing in 
the world can be represented as an object. 

Each object can have its own: 
* Properties 
* Events 
* Methods



* PROPERTIES (CHARACTERISTICS) 
Both of the cars share common characteristics. 
 Programmers call these characteristics the 
properties of an object.

* Each property has a name and a value, and each of 
these name/value pairs tells you something about 
each individual instance of the object. 

* AN EVENT

Programmers choose which events they respond to. 
When a specific event happens, that event can be 
used to trigger a specific section of the code. 

Scripts often use different events to trigger different 
types of functionality. 

So a script will state which events the programmer 
wants to respond to, and what part of the script 
should be run when each of those events occur. 

* METHOD 

When you use a method, you do not always need to 
know how it achieves its task; you just need to know 
how to ask the question and how to interpret any 
answers it gives you
