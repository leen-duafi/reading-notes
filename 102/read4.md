# Control flow :
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

** Code ** is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

** For example **, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the Submit button for the form.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### operator :

JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

* **A binary** operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator
( 3+4 or x*y.)


* **A unary operator** requires a single operand, either before or after the operator(For example, x++ or ++x.)




* **Assignment operators**
An assignment operator assigns a value to its **left** operand based on the value of its **right** operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
