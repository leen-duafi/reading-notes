# function

** A function**

 in JavaScript is **similar to a procedure**â€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, **but** for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. **To use a function**, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

 **JavaScript Function Syntax**
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

**Function names** can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

* The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

* Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

* Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.


** Function Invocation **

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:



**Function Return**

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

**Why Functions?**

* You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

* You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
