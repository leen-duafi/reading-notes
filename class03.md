## Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)


The **<address>** element has 
quite a specific use: to contain 
contact details for the author of 
the page.

It can contain a physical address, 
but it does not have to. For 
example, it may also contain a 
phone number or email address


The **ins** element can be used 
to show content that has been 
inserted into a document, while 
the **del** element can show text 
that has been deleted from it.


The **s** element indicates 
something that is no longer 
accurate or relevant (but that 
should not be deleted)

The unordered list is created 
with the **<ul>** element.

**<li>**
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li> tag 
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)


The ordered list is created with 
the **<ol>** element.

**<li>**
Each item in the list is placed 
between an opening <li> tag 
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.

## Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

**hidden**
This property simply hides any 
extra content that does not fit in 
the box.

**scroll**
This property adds a scrollbar to 
the box so that users can scroll 
to see the missing content.

**Border**
Every box has a border (even if 
it is not visible or is specified to 
be 0 pixels wide). The border 
separates the edge of one box 
from another.

**Margin**
Margins sit outside the edge 
of the border. You can set the 
width of a margin to create a 
gap between the borders of two 
adjacent boxes.

**Padding**
Padding is the space between 
the border of a box and any 
content contained within it. 
Adding padding can increase the 
readability of its contents.

**color-width**
border-top-color
border-right-color
border-bottom-color
border-left-color

**border width**
border-top-width
border-right-width
border-bottom-width
border-left-width

**border style examole**
p.one {border-style: solid;}
p.two {border-style: dotted;}
p.three {border-style: dashed;}
p.four {border-style: double;}
p.five {border-style: groove;}
p.six {border-style: ridge;}
p.seven {border-style: inset;}
p.eight {border-style: outset;


**inline**
This causes a block-level 
element to act like an inline 
element.

**block**
This causes an inline element to 
act like a block-level element.

**inline-block**
This causes a block-level 
element to flow like an inline 
element, while retaining other 
features of a block-level element.

**none**
This hides an element from the 
page. In this case, the element 
acts as though it is not on the 
page at all (although a user could 
still see the content of the box if 
they used the view source option 
in their browser).

##  Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)

* The name must begin with 
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an 
underscore (_). It must not start 
with a number. 

* All variables are case sensitive, 
so score and Score would be 
different variable names

* The name can contain letters, 
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an 
underscore (_).

* Use a name that describes the 
kind of information that the 
variable stores. 


* you cannot use keywords or 
reserved words. Keywords 
are special words that tell the 
interpreter to do something. 


* If your variable name is made 
up of more than one word, use a 
capital letter for the first letter of 
every word after the first word. 

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

**LOOPS & ARRAYS** 
Loops are very helpful when 
dealing with arrays if you want to 
run the same code for each item 
in the array. 


This loop will continue to run 
for as long as the condition in 
the parentheses is true. That 
condition is a counter indicating 
that,

The key difference between 
**a whi1e loop** and a **do whi1e loop** is that the statements in 
the code block come before the 
condition. This means that those 
statements are run once whether 
or not the condition is met.
