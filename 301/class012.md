|SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.  |
|SQL databases have predefined schema | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.   |
|QL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL |NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb     |
|SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)|NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )|     
|SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerfu|NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.     |

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
**Give a real world example.**
**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL donâ€™t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

**Give a real world example.**
**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
**Which type of database is best for scalability?**
